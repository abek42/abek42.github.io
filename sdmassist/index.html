<p>This is the Github repository for SDM-Assist software which is listed in the research paper &quot;<em>SDM-assist software to design site-directed mutagenesis primers introducing “silent” restriction sites.</em> published in BMC Bioinformatics 2013, 14:105; available at DOI: <strong><a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-105">10.1186/1471-2105-14-105</a></strong> </p>
<p>The SDM-Assist software:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows the user to generate and choose primers for SDM that contain a unique restriction site identity allowing for highly efficient identification of ‘mutated clones’ by a simple restriction digest.</li>
<li>Scores suggested primer pairs on factors such as Tm, GC content, 5 prime and 3 prime-stability and secondary structure.</li>
<li>Allows user to customize choice of available restriction enzymes to SDM-Assist for inserting silent restriction sites in the primers.</li>
<li>Exports all suggested primer sequences along with detailed information on them into an excel or text file.</li>
<li>Provides brief tips for primer design, logs the sequence of events as readable text in the display window.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="download-software">Download Software</h2>
<p>To use the SDM-Assist software you will need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adobe Air Runtime</li>
<li>SDM-Assist Installer Package</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="adobe-air-runtime">Adobe Air Runtime</h3>
<p><em>(Skip this step if you already have Adobe Air Runtime installed)</em><br>Due to events beyond the control of the authors, Adobe Air Runtime is now managed by a third-party entity called Harman International. For sake of simplicity, all relevant installer files are provided here, but you can also get the Air Runtime installer from Harman International <strong><a href="https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime">https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime</a></strong></p>
<p>Their website contains the latest state of the runtime and will also provide helpful hints on common installer issues.</p>
<p>If you wish, you can access the installer here also:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><em><a href="./AdobeAIRWINv33.exe">Windows Installer .exe</a></em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em><a href="./AdobeAIRMacv33.dmg">Mac Installer package (.dmg)</a></em></strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sdm-assist-installer-package">SDM-Assist Installer Package</h3>
<p>The package is common for both Windows and Mac and can be found here: <strong><em><a href="./SDMAssistv0.36.air">SDM-Assist Installer</a></em></strong></p>
<h3 id="install-instructions">Install instructions</h3>
<ol>
<li>If Adobe AIR is not installed on your machine you will need to install it first. Save the relevant files to your local system and then run the installer.</li>
<li>After step 1 (unless not needed), download the SDM-Assist AIR Package and &quot;Open&quot; it.</li>
<li>In the options screen, you will be asked if you want to create a desktop icon. Please check this box so that the application icon is available on the desktop.</li>
<li>Uninstalling SDM-Assist: To uninstall from Windows, Go to Control Panel&gt;Uninstall Program and select SDM-Assist. Click ‘Uninstall’/’Remove’ to remove the application.<br>Note: If you get an Error #2032, try clearing the History cache and cookies on the browser. Alternately try using another browser (application not new window) to install the SDM-Assist.</li>
